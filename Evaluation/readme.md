# Description:
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (main.ipynb) that implements two important image quality metrics: NIQE (Natural Image Quality Evaluator) and PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio). These metrics are fundamental tools in image processing and computer vision for evaluating the quality and fidelity of images.

# File:

**main.ipynb**: This notebook provides Python implementations of both NIQE and PSNR metrics. It includes explanations, code, and examples of how to utilize these metrics for image quality assessment. The notebook allows users to compute the NIQE score for a given image and calculate the PSNR between two images.

# Usage:
After cloning this repositry
Open main.ipynb in a Jupyter environment such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Make sure to replace niqe_pris_params and images with correct image path
Follow the instructions and run the code cells to compute the NIQE score or PSNR between images.
Experiment with different images to evaluate their quality using NIQE or compare images using PSNR.
